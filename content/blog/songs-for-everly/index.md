After sharing [Everly's story](/), I got separate emails from both Angela and Matt, telling me they had written songs inspired by Everly.

I listen to these songs often, and they help me lean into my pain and find some hope. My cousin [Tim Lauer](https://www.timlauermusic.com/) put it well:

> I suppose in a situation that feels so helpless ...and anything we might say seems ridiculous, we responded in the way that was most natural for us.

I'm so touched by Everly's impact and how much love and talent my family and friends have shown us through this art. [Angela Lauer](https://www.instagram.com/angelalauer/), [Jessie Early](http://www.jessieearly.com/) and [Matt Dally](https://www.instagram.com/MattDally/)... THANK YOU.

Please check out their songs below and their other amazing work as well.
