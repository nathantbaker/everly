Day 18: #TeamEverly Update — Everly is still stable and getting lots of love. Her ability to blow bubbles is legendary.

<< If you are just jumping into our updates, our daughter Everly was born on December 28. She has OI, which is short for Osteogenesis Imperfecta. It's commonly called brittle bone disease. It means she fractures her bones easily. She was born with at least 40 fractures in her ribs, arms, legs and her clavicle. She has one of the more severe types of OI. Because of the irregular shape of her ribs, Everly's lungs didn't have the room to grow into big lungs. As far as her medical prognosis, she's in a grey area. One of our medical professionals we trust says he or she has seen babies similar to Everly who have made it... and some who have not. We are thankful God is in control and one of the reasons we're being so open about Everly's journey is so we have an army of people who know how to pray. Will you join us in the fight? We so appreciate your support! >>

Here’s a video of Everly blowing bubbles. Her breathing tube causes saliva secretions in the same way that having a piece of candy in your mouth makes your mouth water up.

The nurse regularly suctions her up, but I do wonder if she enjoys blowing bubbles. She can blow some pretty legendary ones.

There hasn’t been any change to Everly’s care. She is stable and getting lots of love from family.

Tonight Colby and I are headed to the hospital to have a slumber party with Everly in her room. Sometimes it’s hard to spend long periods of quality time with our daughter, so spending the night with her should be really fun.

We continue to pour our hearts out to family and God.

Thanks for the continued prayers and support. If you are wanting to know how to help, consider donating to an OI organization in honor of Everly. Expand this post to see OI organizations that Colby and I recommend supporting: https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10100301905700692

Today’s lesson: When a baby soils a diaper, grab two new ones, not one.

Please pray that:

- God heals Everly.
- God will bring us all closer to Him.
- Our family will be able to be fully present when loving Everly.

Much love from Team Everly
