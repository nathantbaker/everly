An update for the day: Everly was born via c-section and is in the nicu. The next step for Everly is seeing how she does with breathing for herself more over the coming days. A geneticist will meet with us tomorrow to better reinterpret the X-ray. Dr markham heavily expects OI as predicted though. Everly has maybe 20-40 breaks in at least her ribs, arms and legs. We can also start to figure out when we'd start treatments to strengthen her bones tomorrow. Tonight the goal is to make sure Everly has the right amount of pain medicine and to monitor when we can begin moving her slowly away from the ventaliator and oxygen. Right now we don't have enough information to see a trend with her breathing ability. Colby's surgery went perfectly and she is recovery well. Thanks to God for bringing Everly to us safety. Please continue to pray that she will eventually be able to breath on her own. Go Everly Go!
