Sunday's the big day. Please pray that (1) Everly will come to us safely, (2) that her lungs will be awesome at taking nice deep breaths, and (3) that God will draw us all closer to him.

We arrive at Vandy for a scheduled c-section at noon Sunday, with the surgery likely happening around 2. We'll post when Everly is doing well enough for visitors.

The best place to check for news on Sunday and going forward will be on Facebook. Family will be posting when we can. Just know I'll be bad at texting people back, starting right... about now. Nashville friends, you're in luck. You can also hunt down Daniel and have him forward you news. I'll be texting him updates throughout the day that he can pass along.

Thanks for all the love, prayer and support. You all have been so supportive. It's amazing. We love you!
